  ## Syntax
  # [tj, tp, tb, lj, lp, lb, li, rj, rB, info] = <../get_tj.m *get_tj*> (p, f, lb0)
  
  ## Description
  # Obtains scaled ages at metamorphosis, puberty, birth and the scaled lengths at these ages;
  # Food density is assumed to be constant.
  # Multiply the result with the somatic maintenance rate coefficient to arrive at unscaled ages. 
  # Metabolic acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis, see also get_ts. 
  # Notice j-p-b sequence in output, due to the name of the routine
  #
  # Input
  #
  # * p: 5 or 6-vector with parameters: g, k, l_T, v_H^b, v_H^j v_H^p 
  #
  #     Last value is optional. If ommitted: outputs tp and lp are empty
  #
  # * f: optional scalar with functional response (default f = 1)
  # * lb0: optional scalar with scaled length at birth
  #      or optional 2-vector with scaled length, l, and scaled maturity, vH
  #      for a juvenile that is now exposed to f, but previously at another f
  #  
  # Output
  #
  # * tj: scaled with age at metamorphosis \tau_j = a_j k_M
  #
  #      if length(lb0)==2, tj is the scaled time till metamorphosis
  #
  # * tp: scaled with age at puberty \tau_p = a_p k_M
  #
  #      if length(lb0)==2, tp is the scaled time till puberty
  #
  # * tb: scaled with age at birth \tau_b = a_b k_M
  # * lj: scaled length at end of V1-stage
  # * lp: scaled length at puberty
  # * lb: scaled length at birth
  # * li: ultimate scaled length
  # * rj: scaled exponential growth rate between s and j
  # * rB: scaled von Bertalanffy growth rate between b and s and between j and i
  # * info: indicator equals 1 if successful, 0 otherwise
