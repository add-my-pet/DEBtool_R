  # created 2009/03/24 by Bas Kooijman, modified 2010/02/23
  
  ## Syntax
  # [R, UE0, info] = <../reprod_rate_metam.m *reprod_rate_metam*> (L, f, p)
  
  ## Description
  # Calculates the reproduction rate in number of eggs per time 
  # in the case of acceleration between events b and j
  # for an individual of length L and scaled reserve density f
  #
  # Input
  #
  # * L: n-vector with length
  # * f: scalar with functional response
  # * p: 12-vector with parameters: kap kapR g kJ kM LT v UHb UHp Lb Lj Lp
  #
  #     g and v refer to the values for embryo; scaling is always with respect to embryo values
  #     V1-morphic juvenile between events b and j with E_Hb > E_Hj > E_Hp
  #
  # * Lb0: optional scalar with length at birth (initial value only)
  #
  #      or optional 2-vector with length, L, and scaled maturity, UH < UHp
  #      for a juvenile that is now exposed to f, but previously at another f
  #  
  # Output
  #
  # * R: n-vector with reproduction rates
  # * UE0: scalar with scaled initial reserve
  # * info: indicator with 1 for success, 0 otherwise
  
  ## Remarks
  # Theory is given in comments to DEB3 section 7.8.2.
  # For cumulative reproduction, see <cum_reprod_metam.html *cum_reprod_metam*>, 
  # *This function will be phased out* and replaced by <reprod_rate_j.html *reprod_rate_j*>
    
    ## Example of use
  #  p_R = [.8 .95 .42 1.7 1.7 0 0.2 .012 .0366 .01 .2 .5]; 
  #    reprod_rate_j([.05 .1 1 3]', 1, p_R)
    
  #  Explanation of variables:
  #  R = kapR * pR/ E0
  #  pR = (1 - kap) pC - kJ * EHp
  #  [pC] = [Em] (v/ L + kM (1 + LT/L)) f g/ (f + g); pC = [pC] L^3
  #  [Em] = {pAm}/ v
  # 
  #  remove energies; now in lengths, time only
  # 
  #  U0 = E0/{pAm}; UHp = EHp/{pAm}; SC = pC/{pAm}; SR = pR/{pAm}
  #  R = kapR SR/ U0
  #  SR = (1 - kap) SC - kJ * UHp
  #  SC = f (g/ L + (1 + LT/L)/ Lm)/ (f + g); Lm = v/ (kM g)
  #
  # unpack parameters; parameter sequence, cf get_pars_r
